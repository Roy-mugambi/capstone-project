### About: Real Estate Analysis and Price prediction of house units


**Dataset Link:** https://github.com/Roy-mugambi/capstone-project/blob/main/Boston.csv


### Questions to be answered in the file:

- How does crime affect the price of real estate?

- Show the trend or nature of relationship between the house rates and the rest of the parameters

- Find the model suitable for predicting the price of a given house given the correlated variable


### Approach Used:

I used correlation matrix to visualize and show relationship between house rates and the determining factors including Taxes, No. of bedrooms and Age of building among others.

Used scatter plots to show the distribution of housing units in relation to insecurity rates as a way of answering the first question.

Later used linear regression from sklearn python package to train a price prediction model. 

Calculated the Coefficient of Determination (R Squared) to test the accuracy of the model when it comes to predicting correct values.


### To Do list:

The project is still on progress and the key remaining objective is:

- **Improving the Model for Better performance**
